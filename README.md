# CodeU

This repository is for the completed assignments given by Google as part of CodeU 2017.

There will be a total of six assignments completed in Java.


******************************
Assignment 1 - Getting Started
  Q1 Task:
    "Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other."
        e.g. Listen, Silent ⇒ True Triangle, Integral ⇒ True Apple, Pabble ⇒ False
  Q2 Task:
    "Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list."
        e.g. k=1

******************************
Assignment 2 - Ancestors 
  Q1 - Print Ancestors:
    "Given a Binary Tree and a key, write a function that prints all the ancestors of the key in the given binary tree."
    
  Q2 - Common Ancestor
    "Design an algorithm and write  code  to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure."

Assignment 3 - Word Search

  "Given a grid of letters and a dictionary, find all the words from the dictionary that can be formed in the grid.
    The rules for forming a word:
      ● You can start at any position.
      ● You can move to one of the 8 adjacent cells (horizontally/vertically/diagonally).
      ● You can't visit the same cell twice in the same word.
      Assume you have a dictionary class with these two methods:
      ● isWord(string): Returns whether the given string is a valid word.
      ● isPrefix(string): Returns whether the given string is a prefix of at least one word in the
      dictionary.
  
  Visual example with 2 rows, 3 columns:
  The dictionary is made up of entries [CAR, CARD, CART, CAT], the list of prefixes is [C, CA, CAR, CARD, CART, CAT]. The correct output in this case would be [CAR, CARD, CAT]."

******************************
Assignment 4 - Counting Islands

  Given a 2-dimensional map of tiles. Each tile is either land or water. Write a function that counts the number of islands.
  Two tiles belong to the same island if they are both land and are adjacent horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
  The input to your function is the number of rows, number of columns, and a 2-dimensional array of booleans, where false means water and true means land. The function should simply return the number of islands.
